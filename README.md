# Electromyographic-Bot

During Summer of 2015, under Institute Technical Summer Projects(ITSP), we chose our own abstract and created robotic car that can be controlled using hand movements by **Gesture Recognition**.


### Gesture recognition :

Recorded Electrical Activity produced by hand muscles, for that, we fabricated our own Electromyography(EMG) circuit..
Data is processed in MATLAB along with Arduino.
Using this data Gesture of hand is recognised.
To have more control of motion of bot, Accelerometer and Gyroscope was created and used.
