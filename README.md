# Electromyographic-Bot

During Summer of 2015, under Institute Technical summer projects, we chose our own abstract and created a bot that can be controlled using simple movement of hand.


### Gesture recognition :

We record Electrical Activity produced by hand muscles.
Data is processed in MATLAB along with Arduino.
Using this data Gesture of hand is recognised.
To have more control of motion of bot, we created Accelerometer and Gyroscope.
We created our own Electromyography(EMG) circuit.

Refer to Project Report for more details.
