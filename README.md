# Electromyographic-Bot
Gesture Recognition using Electromayography.


Electrical Activity produced by hand muscles are recorded.

Data is processed in MATLAB along with Arduino.

Using this data Gesture of hand is recognised.

To implement the concept we created our own Electromyography(EMG) circuit.

To have more control of motion of bot, we created Accelerometer and Gyroscope.
